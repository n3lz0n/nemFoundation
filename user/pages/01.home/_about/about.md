        heading: 'About NEM'
        body: 'The NEM network represents a new generation of blockchain software. Although it’s often grouped with cryptocurrency networks, NEM was built with 100% original code on a ‘blue ocean’ approach, meaning it’s a platform on which anyone can manage any data and build applications to suit their specific needs. It’s designed to merge all the strengths of distributed ledger technology with infinitely expandable functionality, and it currently does so better than any other network.'
